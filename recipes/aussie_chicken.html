            <li>½ cup honey</li>
            <li>¼ cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning salt, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until crisp. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, honey, corn syrup, mayonnaise and dried onion flakes. Remove half of sauce, cover and refrigerate to serve later.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the breasts in the skillet and saute for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned. Remove from skillet and place the breasts into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Apply the honey mustard sauce to each breast, then layer each breast with mushrooms and bacon. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear. Garnish with parsley and serve with the reserved honey mustard sauce.</li>
